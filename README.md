This is the first step to build an AirBnB clone, to begin we are going to build a console to do bored and repetitive tasks more efficiently


# Description of the command interpreter
### What can we do with the console?
  - Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
  - Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
  - Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
  - Update attributes of an object
  - Destroy an object
